      <p>Oliver is a full-stack developer with a combined experience of over two years in agile environments. His first year of experience was at E.On UK working with Typescript & React to refine their customer journey and generate leads in their existing web application and decision engine.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Between placements, Oliver was keen to stay sharp and stepped up as lead developer building an internal application for FDM’s training program. As such, this required him to step up as a leader, while also flexing his knowledge of full-stack application development.</p>
      <br />
      <p>He then moved on to his next placement at Virgin Media/O2, where he specialised as an automation engineer, creating a full stack web application with Django (Python) to optimise the task of uploading firmware to the VMO2 devices for the wider team. He then took on more responsibility by being the key point of contact for the 3rd party inventory management software for the lab, at the same time moving onto an existing back-end project working with Java and Spring Boot in an effort to automate the testing of networking devices.</p>
      <br />
      <p>As well as his software experience, Oliver is also an experienced Mechanical Engineer, and started his own small business. </p>
      <br />
      <p>In a potential role, he’s looking for the opportunity to work towards his long term goal of becoming a senior, full-stack developer, in an organisation that is climate conscious and community focused.</p>
