Oliver is a full-stack developer with a combined experience of a year and a half. His first year of
experience was at E.On UK working with Typescript & React to refine their customer journey and

Infosys development team.
After E.On, Oliver was a lead developer building an internal application for FDM’s training program.
As such, this required him to step up as a leader, while also flexing his knowledge of full-stack
application development from the ground up.

automation engineer, creating a full stack web application with Django (Python) to optimise the task
of uploading firmware to the VMO2 devices for the wider team.

term goal of becoming a senior, full-stack developer, in an organisation that is climate conscious
and community focused.
